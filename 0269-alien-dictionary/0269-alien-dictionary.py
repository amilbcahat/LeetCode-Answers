#         Let me explain why only the first different character matters in lexicographical ordering by using a familiar example - English dictionary:

# ```
# Consider two words:
# "cat" vs "car"

# In English dictionary order:
# 1. First, compare 'c' = 'c' (same, move on)
# 2. Then compare 'a' = 'a' (same, move on)
# 3. Finally compare 't' vs 'r'
#    Since 'r' comes before 't' in English,
#    "car" comes before "cat"
# ```

# Key Point: Once we find 't' comes after 'r', that's ALL we learn about the alphabet order.

# Why?
# ```
# "cat" vs "car"
# - We learn 'r' comes before 't'
# - The position of any characters after this doesn't matter
# - Because just like English, words are sorted by their first point of difference
# ```

# Real Example from problem:
# ```
# "wrt" vs "wrf"
# w = w (same)
# r = r (same)
# t â‰  f (FIRST DIFFERENCE!)
# - We learn 't' comes before 'f'
# - This is the ONLY valid information about letter ordering
# - Any characters after this wouldn't give us valid information about the alien alphabet
# ```

# If we didn't break:
# ```
# word1 = "abc"
# word2 = "abd"

# Without break:
# - Learn 'c' comes before 'd' (WRONG!)
# - The words are ordered this way because of first difference
# - Later characters don't imply any ordering
# ```
